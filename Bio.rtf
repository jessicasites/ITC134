My name is Jessica Sites.  
I was at my last job for 10 years working as a cardio tech.  
After I was laid off, I thought it might be time for a career change.  
Even though I was very good at my job, I hadn't learned anything new in a long time.  
I am very excited to enter into the ever changing world of tech.  
Although change is uncomfortable and challenging, I welcome the chance to grow. 
I have no idea where this new path will take me, but I'm grateful to be on this journey never-the-less.
