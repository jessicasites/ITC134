\f0\fs26 \cf0 My name is Jessica Sites.  I was at my last job for 10 years working as a cardio tech.  After I was laid off, I thought it might be time for a career change.  Even though I was very good at my job, I hadn\'92t learned anything new in a long time.  I am very excited to enter into the ever changing world of tech.  Although change is uncomfortable and challenging, I welcome the chance to grow.  I have no idea where this new path will take me, but I\'92m grateful to be on this journey. }
